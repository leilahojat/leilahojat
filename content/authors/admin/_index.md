I'm an Assistant Professor of Medicine within the Division of Infectious Diseases and HIV Medicine at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. I also serve as Director of the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program for University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. My research interests include hospital epidemiology, bloodstream infections, and antimicrobial resistance. I am passionate about antimicrobial stewardship as a means of providing high value, equitable patient care.

My personal interests include sustainability, social and economic justice, animal and environmental advocacy, and wellness. I enjoy all things concerning cats and crafts. I love connecting with others with similar interests, so please feel free to contact me about any of these topics!
