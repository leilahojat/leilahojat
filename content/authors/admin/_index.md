I am an Assistant Professor of Medicine within the Division of Infectious Diseases and HIV Medicine at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. I also serve as Director of the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program for University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. My research interests include hospital epidemiology, treatment of bacterial infections, and antimicrobial resistance. I am passionate about antimicrobial stewardship as a means of providing high value, equitable patient care, and to that end, I am seeking to develop a stronger background in health care analytics and informatics.

I have been heavily involved in both clinical and research aspects of COVID-19 management since the beginning of the pandemic. Currently, I am involved in developing a multidisciplinary outpatient center for treatment of patients with post-acute COVID symptoms. 

My personal interests include sustainability, social and economic disparities, mindfulness and self-care, animal rights and environmental advocacy, and support and advocacy for individuals representing marginalized communities, including chronically homeless individuals, individuals seeking asylum, people who inject drugs, and people living with HIV. I enjoy all things cats, crafts, and running. 

I love connecting with others with similar interests, so please feel free to reach out to connect on any of these topics!
