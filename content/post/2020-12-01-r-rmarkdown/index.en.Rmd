This site was created using the [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/) website builder and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator, with deployment by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and hosting on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Coding was done in Rstudio using the [blogdown package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blogdown/blogdown.pdf). More information and instructions on using Wowchemy can be found on their [website](https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/). Example R studio code for the Wowchemy starter-academic template can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-academic). My subdomain name was obtained through [Rbind support](https://support.rbind.io/about/) by filing an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/rbind/support/issues).  Additionally, the original site development closely followed the YouTube CradleToGraveR tutorial, which can be found at this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqvaoeh1W4). 

Thanks for visiting my website, and look out for ongoing updates!
