<p>This website was built with blogdown within R Studio using Wowchemy and Netflify web-building tools with hosting on Github. See <a href="https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/" class="uri">https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/</a> for instructions on how to get started with building a site using these tools. Example R studio code for the Wowchemy starter-academic template can be found at <a href="https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-academic" class="uri">https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-academic</a>. Additionally, the original site development followed the YouTube CradelToGraveR tutorial which can be found at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqvaoeh1W4" class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqvaoeh1W4</a>.
