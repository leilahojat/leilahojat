<p>This site was created using the <a href="https://wowchemy.com/">Wowchemy</a> website builder and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> static site generator, with deployment by <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and hosting on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. Coding was done in Rstudio using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blogdown/blogdown.pdf">blogdown package</a>. More information and instructions on using Wowchemy can be found on their <a href="https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/">website</a>. Example R studio code for the Wowchemy starter-academic template can be found on <a href="https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-academic">GitHub</a>. My subdomain name was obtained through <a href="https://support.rbind.io/about/">Rbind support</a> by filing an issue on <a href="https://github.com/rbind/support/issues">GitHub</a>. Additionally, the original site development closely followed the YouTube CradleToGraveR tutorial, which can be found at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqvaoeh1W4">link</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting my website, and look out for ongoing updates!</p>
