abstract: "People exposed to COVID-19 have a risk of developing disease, and health care workers are at risk at a time when they are badly needed during a health care crisis. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been used as treatment and are being considered as prophylaxis. Our patient developed COVID-19 while on hydroxychloroquine and although more work is needed, this calls into question the role of these medications as preventive therapy."
